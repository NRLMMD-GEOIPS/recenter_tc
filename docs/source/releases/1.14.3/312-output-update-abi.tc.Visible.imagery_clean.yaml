    This PR stems from PR #427 on the GeoIPS open source repo. Essentially, the updates
    we made to certain readers affected the yaml output of
    abi.tc.Visible.imagery_clean.sh. This was a very simple PR and was just an update
    to the aforementioned output. There are two lines added to the yaml file which stem
    from new metadata added to our xarray object, adding the source_filenames field.
