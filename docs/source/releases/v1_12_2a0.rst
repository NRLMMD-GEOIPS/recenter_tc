Version 1.12.2a0 (2024-29-03)
*****************************

* Update: Update logging functions to use ``log_with_emphasis`` in ``geoips`` 


Updates
=======

Update logging functions to use ``log_with_emphasis`` in ``geoips`` 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed manual logging with lots of "********************" string literals and 
replaces it with a built in logging function implemented in geoips. 

This update does not change any functionality, but some logged out statements 
will now have slightly different formatting.
