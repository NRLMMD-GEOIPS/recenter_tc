Updates
=======

Update logging functions to use ``log_with_emphasis`` in ``geoips``
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed manual logging with lots of "********************" string literals and
replaces it with a built in logging function implemented in geoips.

This update does not change any functionality, but some logged out statements
will now have slightly different formatting.

Bug Fix
=======

Re-added GeoIPS ``single_source:print_area_def`` to ``recenter_tc.py``
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Stems from GEOIPS#464, 2024-04-15: Finish Log with Emphasis Function*

The PR mentioned above improved the log with emphasis function but ended up removing
``geoips/plugins/modules/procflows/single_source.py:print_area_def`` function as it was
not used within GeoIPS. However, when running ``create_plugin_registries``, we get an
error within ``recenter_tc/plugins/modules/sector_adjusters/recenter_tc.py`` as that
module uses the aforementioned function. This Bug Fix re-implements ``print_area_def``
and refactors that function to use the ``log_with_emphasis`` function instead.
