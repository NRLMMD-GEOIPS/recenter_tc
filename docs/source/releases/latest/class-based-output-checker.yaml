enhancement:
- title: 'Convert fdeck output_checker from module-based to class-based'
  description: |
    Converts the module-based 'fdeck' output_checker from module-based to class-based.
    This change was necessary as we've completely refactored all GeoIPS output_checker
    plugins from module-based to class-based, in order to make better use of shared
    functionality. This is the only interface which has been fully converted to
    class-based, as we wanted to remove any reference to the ``plugin.module``
    attribute.

    This should NOT be merged until https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips/pull/1238
    has been merged into GeoIPS' main branch.
