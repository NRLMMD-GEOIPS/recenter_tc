bug fix:
- title: 'Switch to akima86 from pypi rather than git'
  description: |
    Updated the version of akima86 in pyproject.toml from pointing to
    a branch on the git repository to, instead, use * and pull from
    pypi. Akima86 recently became buildable using meson and has been
    uploaded to pypi.
