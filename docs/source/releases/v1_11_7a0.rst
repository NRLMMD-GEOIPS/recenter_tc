Version 1.11.7a0 (2023-10-06)
*****************************

* Refactor: Update recenter-tc to use 'output_checkers' interface.
* BugFix: Rename archer_image.py:name to 'archer_image'

Bug Fixes
=========

Rename archer_image.py:name to 'archer_image'
---------------------------------------------

With the addition of 382 Raise Error For Duplicate Plugins PR on GeoIPS, we have tested
for duplicate plugin names and found that archer_fix.py:name and archer_image.py:name
were both named 'archer_fix'. We have changed the name in archer_image to 'archer_image'
to fix this.

Refactoring Updates
===================

Update Recenter TC to use the 'output_checkers' interface
---------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#293: 2023-08-24, Create interface for compare outputs*

Update the fdeck output checker to be a full "output_checkers" plugin, so it
can be directly used from the new geoips repo output_checkers interface.
